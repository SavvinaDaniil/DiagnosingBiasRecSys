## Getting Started

To get started with the Diagnosing Bias in Recommender Systems project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.8

## Installation

1. Create and activate a conda virtual environment:

   ```bash
   conda create --name biasenv python=3.8
   conda activate biasenv
   ```

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SavvinaDaniil/DiagnosingBiasRecSys.git
   cd DiagnosingBiasRecSys
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage

Once you have completed the installation steps, you can now run the bias analysis experiment using the provided Jupyter notebook.

1. Start the Jupyter notebook server:

   ```bash
   
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Make sure that jupyter points to the jupyter installed from the requirements file. You may need to deactivate and activate the environment again.

2. Open the notebooks from the project directory.
